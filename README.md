I don't See Ferrari coming
Inspired by my admiration for Red Bull and Formula 1 cars while watching a race, I came up with the idea of creating a 3D model of an F1 car in the midst of a drift. I started with an elongated oval shape for the base and carved out space for the chassis. Then, I added the wheel designs. For the finishing touches, I incorporated aerodynamic features, added the team name and number, and completed the design with a simple yet effective style.
